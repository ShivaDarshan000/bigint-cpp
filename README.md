# BigInt Implementation in C++

## 📌 Overview
This project is a C++ implementation of **BigInt (arbitrary precision integers)** that can handle numbers larger than the built-in data types (`int`, `long long`).  
It supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparison.

## 🚀 Features
- Handles very large integers beyond the limit of primitive types.
- Supports:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Comparison operators
- Uses `vector<int>` internally to store digits.
- Includes sign handling (+/-).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: **C++**
- Standard: **C++11 and above**
